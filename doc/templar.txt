*Templar.nvim*
A template manager with field expansion.

Hit |gO| to see the table of contents.


Introduction~
							       *templar-intro*

Templar.nvim is only a enhanced version of |skeleton|, relying on the
|BufNewFile| autocommand.

Here is how it basically works:
1. |BufNewFile| autocmd is triggered for a new file
2. Search for the corresponding template in `templates/*` runtime files.
3. Expand the fields specified in the previously found template.
4. Set the lines of the file to the expanded template content.

Goals~
    1. Be easy to use
    2. Get out of the way as soon as the work is done
    3. Allow for powerfull field expansion.

Non-goals~
    1. User interaction during expansion (see goal 2)

============================================================================
1. Registering template files
							    *templar-register*

Registering a template is adding an autocmd to Nvim, which triggers templar
when a new file of the given extension is opened.

							    *templar.register*
Use `templar.register(regex)` lua function to register a new template.

For this, here is a lua example snippet >
    lua << EOF
    local templar = require'templar'
    templar.register('*.h')
    templar.register('*.vim')
    templar.register('doc/*.txt')
    EOF
<
This registers templates for c headers, vim files and help files.
When opening a new `.h` file, `templar` wil search for `templates/template.h`
files in your runtime files.
In the examples the `doc/*.txt` entry will search in
`templates/doc/template.txt` in your runtime files.

============================================================================
2. Writing template files
							     *templar-writing*

Lets go throught an example to see how to write a templar template file.
Consider the examples lua snippet above, and espacially the c header file.
Here is an example template file for c header >

    #ifndef %{'__' . substitute(toupper(expand('%:t')), '\(\.\|-\)', '_', 0) . '__'}
    #define %{0}

    %{CURSOR}

    #endif /* %{0} */
<
The syntax is pretty basic, we call every `%{*}` part a field.
As we see we have 3 types of fields here :

    `%{VimL}`		This fields will be evaluated to the Viml expression
			they contain. The value will then be stored in a 0
			based array so that you can recall their values.
			Note: In VimL fields, you can see that `expand('%')`
			will return the file which triggered `BufNewFile`
			autocommand.

    `%{N}`		With these fields you can recall a previously
			evaluated field. In our example we recall the
			first (0-based indexing) field value.

    `%{CURSOR}`		This is where the cursor will be after template
			expansion.

Note: More special fields might come, like a special `%{INCLUDE}`
